### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
  

### What I learned

Gained more insight about using rem vs px for font sizing. I am still gaining more knowledge of using CSS display concepts. For instance I still could not grasp the correct display syntax to get the "Greg Hooper" name to line up exactly beside the avatar. I'd love to get any suggestions to tweak that.

### Goals

To get even better at manipulating flex box, grid, and other properties to help future challenges and projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - When I want a user-friendly explanation of CSS concepts, this is where I'll head first.
